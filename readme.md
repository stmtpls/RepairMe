# RepairMe

## TLDR

The idea behind the project was the development of a platform for the reporting of damaged public property (e.g. broken pavement parts, rusty fences, etc.). Using this web platform, it would be easier for local governments to quickly identify and resolve issues related to damaged public properties. As a result this crowdsourced platform would benefit the public using reports created by users, that hoped that the identified damages would be “repaired”, hence the name of the platform.

While the software cannot be shared due to ethical and legal restrictions, the end product can be found in the below link.

## Takeaways from the project

1. Back end web development with python

The project was a very good opportunity to implement Python programming skills, combining them with different technologies (jinja2, Google Cloud Storage) and working hard on the effective interconnection of all of them. Debugging was a much complex procedure, inspecting multiple layers of operation and different connection points, following the flow of data entered from the user, being successfully and correctly transferer in the database and later also being retrieved again in the html and presented in the UI, resulting in a seamless operation of the website and flow of data.

2. Use of Google Cloud Storage and jinja2

This project helped into grasping a better understanding of the operation principles and functionality of the Google Cloud Storage as well as Jinja2. In order to develop the platform, gathering online information and material I identified tools and methods that could be used in the project, moving steadily one step at a time.

3. Implementation of the designed framework

While having a great start on the project, defining the end goal and the framework of the website, I faced many difficulties in the implementation stage, recognizing design problems that were even based on restrictions of the technologies that were used. As a result, I followed a twisted path, coming up with alternative solutions and redesigning the python program; and while the end result matched the initial design, the technology behind it was different compared to the initial prototype.

4. Debugging and testing

Developing a complete project including front and back end development, cleaning and improving the code throughout the process, the importance of standardized testing and debugging became clear. While mistakes are expected in such a process, no mistake needs to be made twice.
